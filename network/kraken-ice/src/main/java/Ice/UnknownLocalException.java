/**
 * This exception is raised if an operation call on a server raises a
 * local exception. Because local exceptions are not transmitted by
 * the Ice protocol, the client receives all local exceptions raised
 * by the server as {@link UnknownLocalException}. The only exception to this
 * rule are all exceptions derived from {@link RequestFailedException},
 * which are transmitted by the Ice protocol even though they are
 * declared <tt>local</tt>.
