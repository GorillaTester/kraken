/**
 * Create a per-client session with the router. If a
 * {@link SessionManager} has been installed, a proxy to a {@link Session}
 * object is returned to the client. Otherwise, null is returned
 * and only an internal session (i.e., not visible to the client)
 * is created.
 * 
 * If a session proxy is returned, it must be configured to route
 * through the router that created it. This will happen automatically
 * if the router is configured as the client's default router at the
 * time the session proxy is created in the client process, otherwise
 * the client must configure the session proxy explicitly.
