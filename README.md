# NOTICE
This is the original krakenapps repo as forked from nchovy/kraken. The majority of this code is not needed for OpenSOC, and has not been looked at by us. We wanted to keep a copy of the original code in case the parent repo would go the way of krakenapps.org. However, the code on this branch should be considered unsupported and of unknown quality. Any bugs that need to be fixed in the OpenSOC specific code will be fixed elsewhere (master, a feature branch, in OpenSOC, etc...)

Developers swim at your own risk...
